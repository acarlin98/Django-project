# Django-project

## This Repo represents my collective work and projects I actively work on.

* What was your motivation?
* Why did you build this project?
* What problem does it solve?
* What did you learn?
* What makes your project stand out?
* If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

This is where I keep my complete projects, work in progress projects and code snippets.
I need a central place to keep all of my personal work.
This allows me to have a single point of reference if I ever need information for future projects.
